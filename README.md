# Procedural-Generation-Ground-Tiles-Item-Spawns
 Script of interest: Spawner 
 
 In this demo, I randomly generate ground tiles and an inspector-defined number of random items at random positions/rotations.
 Designers can set (1) Grid size for the number of tiles to generate (2) lower and upper X/Z positions to spawn objects within (3) List of objects to be randomly chosen from (4) Number of objects to spawn.
 
 Two object types are included for demo purposes - a ball that can be rolled and a cube that pushes the player backwards.
